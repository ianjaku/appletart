# What is appletart?

appletart is a small library that provides a simple store for pure js development.

In other words, we help you build sites where you're not using a front-end framework.

# How does it help me?

We make a reactive store which makes pure js front-end development easy as cake

# Is it worth installing your library?

Our library is incredibly small, literally 3kb in size.
In comparison to Angular 2 which is 111kb in size (minified).

So there really isn't a big risk, we just try to provide some structure to pure js projects.

# I'm using Typescript

Great! We love typescript.

That's why appletart has been built from the ground up with typescript.

In other words, our typescript support is fantastic ;)
