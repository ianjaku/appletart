# What is appletart?

appletart is a small frontend library which helps you with front-end development when you don't want to use react/vue/angular.

The library is only 7kb in size but contains pretty much everything you need to build a great app!

# Is it worth installing your library?

Our library is incredibly small, literally 7kb in size.
In comparison to Angular 2 which is 111kb in size (minified).

So there really isn't a big risk, all it really does is provide some structure and some sweet helpers to your javascript projects.

# I'm using Typescript

Great! We love typescript.

That's why appletart has been built from the ground up with typescript and has full typescript support.
