# What is appletart

appletart (pronounced Apple Tart) is a small library that provides a simple store for pure js development.

In other words, we help you build sites where you're not using a front-end framework.

# Why was appletart made

I'm currently not happy with the state of front-end frameworks. Vue/Angular/React are too big for most websites and generally
don't work with the html you already have. Libraries like stimulusjs are built up very oddly in my opinion.

appletart is our attempt at solving all of these problems!
